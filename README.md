# UBC CPSC Graduation Check 
Authors: Kenji, Joel 

## About:
This project is 100% written in prolog, and will be able to check your graduation requirements for UBC CS degree. The **instructions** are simple:

* Create a text file (i.e. courses.txt), and for each line enter a course you have completed, with a space sepearting the course subject and number (e.g. 'CPSC 110')
	* Be Careful! Don't leave leading or trailing whitespaces on any line!
	* courses.txt and courses2.txt are good examples
* Start SWI-Prolog with `swipl`
* Type `?- [recommender].`
* Type `start.`
* Now just follow the instructions! You will be able to see your graduation requirement check and you can additionally prompt it for some CPSC course info. Note that any error in the formating of the text file will result in unexpected behavior. It is the user's responsibility to provide a correctly formatted file.
